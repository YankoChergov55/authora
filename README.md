# **Authora**

> Lightweight authentication API with input validation, JWT-based authentication and testing implemented using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## üöÄ Overview

### **Authora** is a foundational backend service focused on secure authentication and robust data validation. It's part of a broader learning mission to master backend development through real-world implementations.

---

## üîß Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express
- **Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose
- **Validation**: Zod (schema + request validation)
- **Security**: bcryptjs, helmet
- **Auth**: JWT (Access & Refresh Tokens, cookie-based)
- **Logging**: Pino
- **Testing**: Jest + Supertest (unit & integration)
- **Environment Config**: dotenv
- **Tooling**: ESLint + Prettier, Nodemon

## üîê Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env` file to manage environment-specific configurations. You must create a `.env` file in the root directory to run the project successfully.

## üîê Environment Variables

This project uses environment-specific `.env` files to manage configuration for development and testing.
You **must create** the following files in your project root:

### `.env` (for development)

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/authora
NODE_ENV=development

JWT_SECRET_ACCESS=your_access_secret_here
JWT_SECRET_REFRESH=your_refresh_secret_here
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRY=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRY=7d
```

---

### `.env.test` (for testing)

```env
NODE_ENV=test
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/authora_test

JWT_SECRET_ACCESS=your_test_access_secret
JWT_SECRET_REFRESH=your_test_refresh_secret
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRY=10s
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRY=30s
```

> **Note**: The test environment uses a separate database (`.env.test`) to isolate test data and prevent pollution of the development database.
> Make sure your test script sets `NODE_ENV=test` to load this file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "NODE_ENV=test jest --runInBand --detectOpenHandles",
  "test:watch": "NODE_ENV=test jest --runInBand --detectOpenHandles --watch"
}
```

### üî∏ Important Notes

- `MONGODB_URI`: Replace with your actual connection string if you're using a remote MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
- `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`: Use long, randomly generated strings in production to protect token integrity.
- **Never commit your `.env` file** ‚Äî it should always be in your `.gitignore`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB instance running (local or cloud)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run in Dev Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üìå Notes

This project is part of a deeper backend development journey ‚Äî not a clone, but a self-driven scenario designed to build precision, resilience, and real-world readiness. While this version focuses on core authentication, input validation, and testing, it represents the starting line, not the finish.

The next phase will take these same principles further:

    Rebuilding the stack using TypeScript + Express + MongoDB

    Adding user-controlled entities (e.g., Todo, Product)

    Applying robust validation, authentication, and testing to every feature

    Designing systems that scale in both structure and complexity

This isn‚Äôt just about writing code ‚Äî it‚Äôs about mastering how backend systems behave, protect themselves, and evolve.
